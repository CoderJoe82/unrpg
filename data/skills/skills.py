# This file currently is a placeholder to remind me I intend to make it. It will be kind of like Elder Scrolls abilities where every time you do something, you get a xp increase to it. But this only applies to skills.

# I'll have the following skill types eventually:
# Crafting : Woodworking, Metalsmithing, etc..
# Gathering: Mining, Herbology, Surveying(runecrafting related)
# Magical: Enchanting, Alchemy, Runecrafting
# Pracitcal: Identification, etc.
